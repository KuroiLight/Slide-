# WindowShift
WindowShift is re-write of my old AutoHotkey script [AHKDocker](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=7095) in C#.
The current implementation is functional but still very rough.

- [x] winapi/mousehook
- [ ] window movement [#1](https://github.com/KuroiLight/WindowShift/issues/1)

- [x] multi-monitor support [#3](https://github.com/KuroiLight/WindowShift/issues/3)
