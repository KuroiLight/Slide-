#### This application is based on the "touch slide" functionality from Preme for Windows, written in C# with hints from my AHKDocker project (in AutoHoktey) years ago.
I'm building this project as a way to re-learn C# after a long hiatus from programming in general.
In a nutshell it will allow you to slide windows offscreen with quick access to them via cursor hover (gifs to come).

### Aims to be:
* #### Fast
* #### Asynchronous
* #### Support Multi-Monitor setups
* #### Configurable via Settings Window

###### Most of the functionality has been implemented, the creation of window containers and mousehook need to be added
