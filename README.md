# WindowShift
WindowShift is re-write of my old AutoHotkey script [AHKDocker](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=7095) in C#.
The current implementation is functional but still very rough.

Implementation Status:
- [x] window classes
- [x] winapi/mousehook
- [x] window movement [#1](https://github.com/KuroiLight/WindowShift/issues/1)
- [x] async ~~multithreaded~~ window movement w/ ability to interrupt
- [x] filter dockpoint with taskbar [#2](https://github.com/KuroiLight/WindowShift/issues/2)
- [x] multi-monitor support [#3](https://github.com/KuroiLight/WindowShift/issues/3)
- [ ] settings interface/saving [#4](https://github.com/KuroiLight/WindowShift/issues/4)
