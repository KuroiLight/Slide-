#### This application is a reimplementation of the "touch slide" functionality from Preme for Windows but completely written in C#.
I'm building this project as a way to re-learn C# after a long hiatus from programming in general.
In a nutshell it will allow you to slide windows offscreen with quick access to them via cursor hover (gifs to come).

### Aims to be:
* #### Fast
* #### Asynchronous
* #### Support Multi-Monitor setups
* #### Configurable via Settings Window

###### Functionality has been completely implemented, except the settings interface. There are still some bugs present mostly related to timing issues.
