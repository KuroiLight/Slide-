# WindowShift
WindowShift is re-write of my old AutoHotkey script [AHKDocker](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=7095) in C#.
The current implementation isn't usable but the majority of the boilerplate code is present and functional.

Implementation Status:
- [x] window classes
- [x] winapi/mousehook
- [ ] window movement #1
- [ ] filter dockpoint with taskbar #2
- [ ] multi-monitor support #3
- [ ] \(possible) window filtering based on window class/attributes
- [ ] proper exception handling, null checks and garbage collection fixes #5
- [ ] performance fixes #5
- [ ] settings interface/saving #4
